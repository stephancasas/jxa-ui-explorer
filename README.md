# JXA UI Elements Explorer

---

> ðŸš¨ **Abandoned Project (Still alive though â€”Â keep reading)**
> 
> In its current form, this project has been abandoned in favor of pursuing a more robust implementation that is based on native macOS APIs and completelyÂ decoupled from Electron.
>
> While I realize that the last commit on this repo was in January of 2022, please note that very slow (then, suddenly, very rapid) progress has been quietly happening behind the scenes. There's been a spike of public interest in JXA and, in general, macOS UI inspection â€” driven primarily by the massive push for AI-related tasks. In an effort to get ahead of that rush, I've spent a ton of time reverse-engineering the APIs related to this area of macOS.
>
> The ideal target is a severely improved version of the original Electron-based app â€” including features like code generation and much more.
